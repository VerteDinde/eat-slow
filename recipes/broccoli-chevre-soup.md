# Broccoli Chevre Soup

This is a solid, creamier soup for those who like their soups rich and creamy. The recipe makes a huge batch - while this recommends a Dutch oven, a regular soup pot will work just fine. I don't recommend a slow cooker for this, as the sausage gets a bit nasty.

## Ingredients

6 tbsp unsalted butter

1 yellow onion

2 carrots

2 heads broccoli

3 cloves garlic

4 cups veggie broth

4 oz chevre

1 bay leaf

1 tbsp tahini

Sea salt & black pepper to taste


## Directions

1. Cook the Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned and no longer pink.  Drain and set aside.
